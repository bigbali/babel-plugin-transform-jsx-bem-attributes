# A plugin for Babel that allows converting 'block', 'elem' and 'mods' props into proper 'className'
## Important notes
This plugin is experimental, and a newer version is already in the works, which will add support for more features,
will not be buggy, and will be usable in your project.
Consider this something you should absolutely not use, as of now.
It's released only so another project which relies on this can pull it from NPM.
